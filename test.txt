for the first test,
i wrote the test in test.js and wrote another code to pass the test in the multiply.js

i realised i had a syntax error which stated that i cannot import statement outside a module,thus
i added the "type"="module" to the package.json
it passed.

for the second test ,i updates the multiply.js with another code to pass the test in the test.js
it passed.

On adding other tests,no updates to the multiply.js were done,and all tests passed



i used .md which allows font style formatting for conclusion of the multiplyTDDtest
